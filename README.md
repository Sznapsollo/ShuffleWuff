# ShuffleWuff
English language learning Tool for kids. 

This is platform I build to do fun and efficient English lessons with my son. 

It is Vue.js single page app, easily deployable requires just any web server. Does not require database - works entirely on file content (which has its limitation when more users would use it in parallel) but for single lessons is perfect.

More description will follow soon (I hope ;-))

## Demo
